    "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "question1": "What is a Canada Immigration Visa?",
    "answer1": "A Canada Immigration (Permanent Resident) Visa is an official document issued by the Canadian government that allows a foreign national to live and work permanently in Canada. It grants the holder most of the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizens, except for the right to vote in elections.",
    "question2": "What is the difference between a Work Permit and Canada Immigration?",
    "answer2": "A Work Permit is a temporary document that allows a foreign national to work in Canada for a specific period and often for a specific employer. Canada Immigration, on the other hand, refers to the process of becoming a permanent resident, which allows you to live and work anywhere in Canada indefinitely.",
    "question3": "Can I apply for Permanent Residence status and Temporary status at the same time?",
    "answer3": "Yes, you can apply for both permanent residence and temporary status simultaneously. This is often referred to as 'dual intent'. For example, you can apply for a work permit or study permit while your permanent residence application is in process.",
    "question4": "How long does the immigration process take?",
    "answer4": "The processing time for immigration applications can vary greatly depending on the program you're applying under, the completeness of your application, and current processing volumes. It can range from a few months to several years. You can check current processing times on the official Government of Canada website.",
    "question5": "Do I need a job offer to immigrate to Canada?",
    "answer5": "It depends on the immigration program you're applying under. Some programs, like certain streams of Express Entry, don't require a job offer. Others, like many Provincial Nominee Programs, do require a valid job offer. Having a job offer can often increase your chances of being selected, even in programs where it's not mandatory.",
    "question6": "What is the minimum language requirement for Canadian immigration?",
    "answer6": "The minimum language requirement varies depending on the immigration program. For most skilled worker programs, you need to demonstrate language proficiency equivalent to Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 7, which is considered 'adequate intermediate proficiency'. This can be demonstrated through approved language tests like IELTS or CELPIP for English, or TEF for French."
